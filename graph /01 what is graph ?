What is a Graph? 
A graph is a non-linear data structure made of: 
• Nodes (Vertices) – store data. 
• Edges – connect pairs of nodes. 

It is useful in real-life applications like maps, circuits, and social networks. 

Types of Data Structures 
• Linear – Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List (sequential). 
• Non-linear – Tree, Graph. 

Graph Terminology 
• Vertex (Node): A point in the graph. 
• Edge: A connection between two vertices. 
• Directed Edge: Has a direction (from one node to another). 
• Undirected Edge: No direction; two-way connection. 

Types of Graphs 
1. Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction. (u, v) = (v, u) 
2. Directed Graph: Edges have direction. ⟨u, v⟩ ≠ ⟨v, u⟩ 
3. Cyclic Graph: Contains at least one cycle. 
4. Acyclic Graph: No cycles. 
5. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): Directed and has no cycles. 
6. Weighted Graph: Edges have weights/costs. 
7. Unweighted Graph: Edges have no weights (assume weight = 1). 

Graph Structure 
• A graph doesn’t need to be closed or circular. 
• Cycle: A path where the start and end node are the same. 
• Tree: A type of graph with no cycles.

Path in Graph 
A path is a sequence of connected nodes: 
• Nodes must be adjacent. 
• No node should repeat. 
• Example: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 is a valid path. 

Degree of Nodes 
• Undirected Graph: 
Degree = number of edges connected to a node. 
Property: 
Total Degree = 2 × Number of Edges 
• Directed Graph: 
o Indegree: Number of incoming edges. 
o Outdegree: Number of outgoing edges. 

Edge Weight 
• Shows the cost of moving between two nodes. 
• If not given, assume weight = 1. 
• Example: In road maps, weight can be distance or time. 

How to Identify a Graph Problem 
Look for these patterns or hints in the problem description: 

�
� 1. Entities (Nodes) & Relationships (Edges) 
• Clue: The problem involves objects/entities (cities, people, computers, rooms, islands, etc.) 
and connections/relationships between them (roads, friendships, wires, paths). 
• Examples: 
o “There are N cities connected by M roads.” 
o “Each person can follow others on a social network.” 
o “You can go from room A to room B through a door.” 
• ✅ Graph Detected: Each entity = node, each relation = edge. 

�
� 2. Movement or Traversal 
• Clue: The problem involves moving from one entity to another and finding paths, distances, 
or reachability. 
• Keywords: 
o “Find shortest path…” 
o “Reach from X to Y…” 
o “Number of steps to go from A to B…” 
• Examples: 
o “Find the shortest path from city A to city B.” 
o “Is there a way to escape the maze?” 
o “How many steps to convert word1 to word2?” 
• ✅ Graph Detected: Movement suggests edges connecting nodes. 

�
� 3. Grid-Based Problems 
• Clue: The problem gives a 2D grid or matrix and allows movement in certain directions 
(up/down/left/right). 
• Examples: 
o “Find the number of islands in a grid.” 
o “Can the rat reach the cheese?” 
o “Find shortest path in maze.” 
• ✅ Graph Detected: Each cell is a node, adjacent cells are edges. 

�
� 4. Dependencies or Order of Tasks 
• Clue: There’s a sequence of tasks, and some must be done before others. 
• Keywords: 
o “Prerequisite…” 
o “Before doing A, do B…” 
o “Find valid order to complete all tasks…” 
• Examples: 
o “Course schedule with prerequisites.” 
o “Task scheduling based on dependency.” 
• ✅ Graph Detected: Directed graph (DAG); use topological sort. 

�
� 5. Connectivity Questions 
• Clue: You're asked whether entities are connected or how many groups exist. 
• Examples: 
o “How many friend groups exist?” 
o “Is the entire network connected?” 
o “Find the number of provinces.” 
• ✅ Graph Detected: Graph is often undirected; use BFS/DFS or Union-Find. 

�
� 6. Recursive or Repetitive Connections 
• Clue: Things are connected recursively, or can keep connecting (chains). 
• Examples: 
o “A calls B, B calls C…” 
o “Dominoes fall one after another.” 
• ✅ Graph Detected: A chain of connected events suggests directed graph. 

�
� 7. Mention of “Neighbor”, “Adjacent”, or “Next” 
• Clue: Items are linked by proximity or direct connections. 
• Examples: 
o “Each node has up to 4 neighbors.” 
o “Find all adjacent rooms.” 
• ✅ Graph Detected: Adjacent = connected = edge in graph.

Final Tip: 

If a problem talks about: 
• Multiple items that are linked, connected, dependent, or navigable, and 
• You need to search, count, or analyze their relationships 
It’s a graph problem!
