✅ Depth First Search (DFS) 

DFS is a traversal technique which involves the idea of recursion and backtracking. DFS goes 
in-depth, i.e., traverses all nodes by going ahead, and when there are no further nodes to 
traverse in the current path, then it backtracks on the same path and traverses other unvisited nodes.  

• Uses recursion or an explicit stack. 
• Suitable for problems that require exploration of all paths or connected components. 

Approach: 
1. Start from a node v. 
2. Mark v as visited. 
3. Store it in the result (solution vector). 
4. For each unvisited neighbor u of v: 
o Recursively call DFS(u). 
5. Continue until all nodes are explored

Time Complexity: 
• O(N + E) 
o N = number of nodes 
o E = number of edges 

Space Complexity: 
• O(N) for visited array + recursion stack. 

void dfs(int node, vector<int> adj[], vector<int> &visited, vector<int> &result) {
    visited[node] = 1;
    result.push_back(node);

    for (int i = 0; i < adj[node].size(); i++) {
        int neighbor = adj[node][i];
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            dfs(neighbor, adj, visited, result);
        }
    }
}
