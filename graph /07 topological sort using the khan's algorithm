Topological Sort – Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS)

🔹 Intuition

Topological sorting means ordering tasks (nodes) so that for every directed edge u → v,
node u comes before node v in the final order.
Kahn’s Algorithm is a BFS-based approach that uses the concept of in-degree —
(the number of incoming edges to a node).
If a node’s in-degree = 0, it has no dependencies, so it can safely appear first.

⚙️ Approach

Calculate In-Degree
For each node, count how many edges point to it.
Push All Nodes with In-Degree = 0 into a Queue
These nodes can be processed first.

Process Queue (BFS)
Pop a node → add it to the result.
Decrease the in-degree of all its neighbors.
If any neighbor’s in-degree becomes 0 → push it to the queue.
Repeat until the queue becomes empty.
The final order is the topological sort.

Extra Tip

You can also use this algorithm to detect cycles:
If the size of the topological order < total number of vertices →
the graph has a cycle.

vector<int> topoSort(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
    vector<int> inDegree(V, 0);

    // Step 1: Calculate in-degree for all nodes
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < adj[i].size(); j++) {
            int neighbor = adj[i][j];
            inDegree[neighbor]++;
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Add all nodes with 0 in-degree to the queue
    queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        if (inDegree[i] == 0) q.push(i);
    }

    // Step 3: BFS traversal
    vector<int> topoOrder;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        topoOrder.push_back(node);

        for (int j = 0; j < adj[node].size(); j++) {
            int neighbor = adj[node][j];
            inDegree[neighbor]--;
            if (inDegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    return topoOrder;
}
