🧩 Shortest Path in an Unweighted (Undirected) Graph
🔹 Concept

In an unweighted graph, all edges have equal weight (cost = 1).
The shortest path from a source node to all other nodes can be found using BFS (Breadth First Search) because BFS explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest distance first.

⚙️ Steps

Create a distance array (dist) and set all values to -1 (unvisited).
Mark the source node as visited and set dist[src] = 0.
Use a queue for BFS traversal.
For each node popped from the queue:
For every unvisited neighbor →
update dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1,
mark as visited, and push into the queue.

After BFS completes, dist[i] holds the shortest distance from the source to node i.

⏱️ Complexity
Time: O(V + E)
Space: O(V)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestPath(vector<vector<int>> &adj, int src) {
        int v = adj.size();
        vector<int> dist(v, -1);
        vector<bool> visited(v, false);

        queue<int> q;
        q.push(src);
        visited[src] = true;
        dist[src] = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (int i = 0; i < adj[node].size(); i++) {
                int neighbor = adj[node][i];
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1;
                    q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        return dist;
    }
};
